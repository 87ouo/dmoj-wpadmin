This is very simple project created to test various possibilities and options
of Django WP Admin.
There are settings prepared for Django 1.3.x, 1.4.x and 1.5.x
There's also SQLite database file with basic data and basic users needed for
testing. Those users are: admin, staff, user (password is always the same as
